Our daily diving trips are scheduled to start at 8:30 AM and end at 4:00 PM. Weather and current conditions permitting, we visit two different dive sites each day, ensuring variety and the best possible experience.

Your first stop is scheduled after 35 to 45 minutes of sailing (or 60 to 90 minutes depending on the locations). During the journey, you'll get to know your fellow passengers and the crew. The dive master will provide you with an onboard briefing about the dive sites and safety procedures.

After each dive, you may wish to participate in a debriefing or identification session of the flora and fauna you have spotted below water level. The actual diving time is determined by your air consumption, local current, and the size of the dive site.`,

    description: `Doświadcz magii Morza Czerwonego z naszymi codziennymi przygodami nurkowymi. Niezależnie od tego, czy jesteś certyfikowanym nurkiem, czy próbujesz nurkowania po raz pierwszy, nasze codzienne wyprawy nurkowe oferują niezapomnianą podwodną podróż przez vibrantowe rafy koralowe i zróżnicowane życie morskie.

Nasze codzienne wyprawy nurkowe rozpoczynają się o 8:30 i kończą o 16:00. Przy sprzyjających warunkach pogodowych i prądowych, odwiedzamy każdego dnia dwa różne miejsca nurkowe, zapewniając różnorodność i jak najlepsze doświadczenie.

Pierwszy przystanek jest zaplanowany po 35 do 45 minutach żeglugi (lub 60 do 90 minut w zależności od lokalizacji). Podczas podróży poznasz swoich współpasażerów i załogę. Mistrz nurkowania przeprowadzi briefing na pokładzie na temat miejsc nurkowych i procedur bezpieczeństwa.

Po każdym nurkowaniu możesz wziąć udział w sesji debriefingowej lub identyfikacji flory i fauny, którą zaobserwowałeś pod wodą. Rzeczywisty czas nurkowania zależy od twojego zużycia powietrza, lokalnych prądów i wielkości miejsca nurkowego.`,
    itinerary: `Harmonogram Dzienny

Poranny odbiór (7:30-8:30): Komfortowy transfer z klimatyzacją z Twojego hotelu.

Odpłynięcie z mariny (~9:00): Wejdź na pokład łodzi, poznaj swojego przewodnika i ciesz się briefingiem przy herbacie lub kawie.

Pierwsze nurkowanie (~10:00): Nurkuj na jednym ze słynnych miejsc Morza Czerwonego.

Przerwa powierzchniowa i lunch: Zrelaksuj się na pokładzie, ciesz się przekąskami i napojami oraz świeżo przygotowanym lunchem w formie bufetu, gdy płyniemy do następnego miejsca.

Drugie nurkowanie (~13:30): Odkryj inny profil rafy, napotykając nowe morskie krajobrazy i życie.

Powrót i drop-off (16:00-17:00): Wróć do mariny, zanim transfer odwiezie Cię do hotelu.`,

Первая остановка запланирована через 35-45 минут плавания (или 60-90 минут в зависимости от местоположения). Во время путешествия вы познакомитесь с другими пассажирами и экипажем. Дайв-мастер проведет брифинг на борту о местах дайвинга и процедурах безопасности.

После каждого погружения вы можете принять участие в брифинге или идентификации флоры и фауны, которую вы наблюдали под водой. Фактическое время дайвинга определяется вашим потреблением воздуха, местным течением и размером места дайвинга.`,
