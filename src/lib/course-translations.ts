What you'll learn

**Primary Care (CPR)** – This teaches you the steps and techniques for handling life-threatening emergencies. You'll practice skills for aiding patients who aren't breathing, have no heartbeat, may have a spinal injury, may be in shock or who may have serious bleeding. You'll learn how to perform **CPR** and continue to monitor the patient, so that you provide every possible chance of survival while waiting for emergency medical services to arrive.

**Secondary Care (First Aid)** – Because many medical conditions are not life-threatening and emergency medical services are sometimes delayed or unavailable, this section teaches you how to provide first aid that eases pain and reduces the risk of further harm. You'll learn to assess a variety of injuries and illnesses and practice bandaging and splinting through knowledge and skill development with realistic scenario practice.

    longDescription: `COURSE OVERVIEW

You'll have most likely learned to dive in the normal fashion with a single tank on your back. But having scuba tanks on your back isn't a requirement for exploring the underwater world. The **PADI Sidemount Diver Specialty** will teach you the fundamentals of diving with one, two or more scuba tanks mounted down your side instead of on your back.

People often ask, why dive sidemount? Those that have experienced this style of diving list the benefits as:

An alternate and often easier way to streamline in the water. You will feel free and less restricted.
Increased air supply without overloading your body with cumbersome and heavy dive equipment.
Enables easier equipment transportation, more relaxed entries and exits as well as reducing strain on the body.
Increases safety with a redundant air source and allows incredibly easy access to your air supply.

What you'll learn

The **PADI Sidemount Diver Specialty** teaches you about the many benefits of diving with a sidemount configuration.

During **one confined water** and **three open water** scuba dives you'll learn how to:

Properly assemble and configure sidemount scuba diving equipment.
Trim your weight system and sidemount gear so you're perfectly balanced in the water.
Manage air by switching second stages as planned, if wearing two cylinders.
Understand the planning considerations and safety concerns for sidemount diving
Respond correctly to potential problems when sidemount diving.

The Scuba Gear You Will Use

All the equipment you will need is provided for the **PADI Sidemount Diver Specialty**. You'll use all the basic scuba gear including a **mask and snorkel**, **fins**, a **wetsuit**, a **buoyancy compensating jacket (BCD)** that carries the scuba tank, a **scuba regulator** to breathe from and gauges to monitor depth and air supply. Your **PADI instructor** will provide the necessary sidemout configuration for the tanks.

Whether sunk on purpose as an artificial reef or the result of a disaster, wrecks open intriguing windows to the past. Most divers find wrecked ships and vessel's fascinating and enjoy unlocking the mysteries they have to offer. They are also usually teeming with aquatic life so are perfect dive sites for the keen underwater naturalists or photographers.

What you'll learn

The **PADI Wreck diving** specialty introduces the fundamentals of limited wreck penetration with line laying techniques. Navigating around and inside wrecks is particularly important as low visibility, silt and poor light penetration mean buoyancy, trim and finning techniques are incredibly important.

With the emphasis on safety, with your **PADI Instructor** you'll cover;

Techniques for diving exploring and navigating shipwrecks
How to avoid common hazards and deal with challenging situations.
How to research and learn the background of your favourite wrecks.
Mapping and measuring wrecks.
Wreck diving equipment considerations.
Considerations and techniques for entering/penetrating intact wrecks.
Experience in planning, organising and making **at least four wreck dives** under the supervision of your **PADI Instructor**.

The Scuba Gear You Will Use

    longDescription: `ОБЗОР КУРСА

Будь то затопленные намеренно как искусственный риф или в результате катастрофы, рэки открывают интригующие окна в прошлое. Большинство дайверов находят затонувшие корабли fascинирующими и любят раскрывать их тайны. Обычно они полны водной жизни, поэтому идеальны для подводных фотографов.

Чему вы научитесь

Специальность **PADI Wreck diving** вводит основы ограниченной пенетрации рэков с техниками прокладки линий. Навигация вокруг и внутри рэков особенно важна.

С акцентом на безопасность, с **инструктором PADI** вы изучите:

Техники исследования и навигации по корабельным рэкам
Как избегать распространённых опасностей и справляться с трудными ситуациями.
Как исследовать и узнавать историю любимых рэков.
Картирование и измерение рэков.
Рассмотрение снаряжения для рэк-дайвинга.
Рассмотрения и техники входа/пенетрации неповреждённых рэков.
Опыт планирования и выполнения **как минимум четырёх рэк-погружений**.

Снаряжение

Всё необходимое снаряжение предоставляется. Инструктор обеспечит **дайв-компьютер** и **навигационные линии/меры**, необходимые для курса.

Продолжайте приключение...

Многие корабельные рэки часто находятся в более глубокой воде. Поэтому курс **PADI Wreck Diver** — естественный компаньон курса **PADI Deep Diver**.`,
